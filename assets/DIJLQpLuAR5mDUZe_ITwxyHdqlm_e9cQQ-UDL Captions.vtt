Universal design is the design of products or environments to allow access to all individuals 

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.566
without the need for specialized accommodations.

4
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:20.166
A classic example of universal design is the curb-cut in sidewalks.

5
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:24.899
Curb-cuts allow those in wheelchairs to safely move from the sidewalk to the curb; 

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.966
but they also help those with strollers, scooters, shopping carts, bikes, or even luggage on wheels. 

7
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:34.166
They inherently accommodate varying needs.

8
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:38.866
These same principles for universal design can be applied to education and training. 

9
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:43.466
Universal Design for Learning aims to target the needs of all learners. 

10
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:47.732
As a global company and with an ever-increasing workforce,

11
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:52.633
designing training inclusive of a broad audience is essential. 

12
00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:58.533
At the core of Universal Design for Learning is allowing for multiple methods of expression. 

13
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:05.499
This means providing variety in our content delivery, methods of engagement, and ways of assessing knowledge. 

14
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.000
Let’s talk about some suggestions for ways to incorporate this variety.  

15
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.600
You could vary the media you present to include both auditory and visual options.

16
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.566
Use graphics or examples representative of varying backgrounds, races, ethnicities, or genders.

17
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:28.399
Use inclusive language such as people, individuals, employees, or colleagues.

18
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.433
Avoid idioms or cultural references that may not translate to a global audience.

19
00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:40.399
Activate background knowledge for varying experience levels or industries.

20
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.866
Give learners different ways to demonstrate their knowledge 

21
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:49.799
like hands-on projects, multiple-choice questions, written responses, or auditory replies.

22
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.033
It can start to feel overwhelming when you begin to broaden your audience, 

23
00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:57.233
but remember, the key word is <b>multiple</b>. 

24
00:01:57.233 --> 00:02:03.466
Including an example in a training from every race, nationality, religion, sexual orientation,

25
00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:09.032
gender, gender identity, socio-economic status, or any other characteristic or protected class 

26
00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:11.699
is neither practical nor possible. 

27
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.533
However, the seemingly small changes you make in considering a broader audience

28
00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:18.766
can affect more people than you think.  

29
00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:24.866
An example of designing for a broader training audience is the use of closed captions or transcripts. 

30
00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:31.266
Captions or transcripts provide the option of written text in addition to listening to auditory speech. 

31
00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:33.899
You might think this only helps those who are deaf, 

32
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.900
but it also helps those who are English language learners or who have a learning disability. 

33
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.466
It could even allow you to access the content if you’ve simply forgotten your headphones 

34
00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:46.699
and want to watch a video in a public space. 

35
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.466
Just like the curb-cuts we mentioned at the beginning, 

36
00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:54.499
the use of captions or transcripts inherently meets the needs of a variety of learners. 

37
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.400
It’s pretty common to design educational experiences based on how we, 

38
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.233
as the course designers, learn most effectively. 

39
00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:07.633
But by remembering to provide multiple means of engagement or content presentation, 

40
00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:10.966
we can better address a broad, global audience 

41
00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:15.866
with varying abilities, learning styles, and preferences.
